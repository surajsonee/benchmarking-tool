Notes:
	There should be a readme that states how to get the code working on your personal machine for local hosting and testing.
	Most of the code you need for the current dashboard is in the "Commercial" folder, with the exception of the CSS, Javascript, 
	and images being in the "static" folder. 

	Github Repository:
		I reccomend cloning this to your own github and using that to update the production server when you're done
		locally testing
