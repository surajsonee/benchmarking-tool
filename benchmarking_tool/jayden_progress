    getting error request has no atribute MOBILE 
        has somthing to do wiht @mobilize decorator 
        mobile is not initalized 
        added mobile = Mobility(app) to init and can move around the app freely

    changed overview in main.views.py
        added a mobile stopper to render the mobile menu rather then the regular one 

    having toruble with variables not defiened 
        uncommented the following lines in mian.overview ln  56
            elec_bill = ElectricalUsage.query.filter_by(customer_id=customer.id).first()
            elec_consumption = elec_bill.consumption
            elec_cost=elec_bill.cost
            elec_rate=elec_cost/elec_consumption
            gas_rate=6.00
        direct to m_comparison from overview 
            m_comparison changes lots of variables

UI meeting feb 3


feb 4th 
    Electrical_ratesdb does not init is empty 
        silly database problem: 
            electrical_rates_upload.py: changed file name bracket to "/" form "\"

    e_rates(def ln1336) retruns a blank list this then becomes a issue when called in ln 1524

    full detection[3] sometimes retuens numbers liek "500 Edmonton"
        Full detectino could use more training - Murray has been told about this 

        add some safety modifiers so that there isnt a NoneType passed on to a variable that causes a error later
        # maybe add a 'Confirm my information" screen


    ln 1333
        indexError list out of range:  elif (a < calculate_total_bill(best_rates[1], e_consumption, True)):

        just commenting out ln 1326 - 1336, not sure what the goal is. i think they want the top rates in sedgwick 

        e_rates: list of indexes of the city in the database 

    adding more pages home-> _home_comparison-> pictures of your appliances 

    cant read line 1389 changed it to file_name = absolute_path + f"/static/upgrades_data.csv" where left slashes made them right


    should add more buttons to home screen ADD appliances - maybe dont do this get a menu working 

    furnace not detection

    this is because the server was not online 




WHAT PAGES DO I HAVE AT THE END OF FEB 4TH

menu  
    looks bad but gets the job done 
    showed peter and joel my ideas for a dynamic menu

my home (m_utility_cost)    
    has a nice graph need to add a energuid rating thing value that murray is working on 
    get some real values on the energy breakdown graph 
    get pictures of your inventory (make those boxes links go to a "add furnace" page) 
    make sure the database is still connected all around 

utility rates (m_home_comparison)
    this really just prints out our database values 
    could use some more innovation 
    maybe a comparison to your own cost 

reduce energy cost (m_upgrades)
    inital cost, savings, payback time -> all not calculated 

    sugestions could use a palce to say 
    more so a "if fridge is shit get this one" kinda deal 
    just showing stock valuse 

        


implemented navebar that was in the web browser. 

    places to add to nav bar

    have to commit session variables to the database so it remembers it for the current user 

need to get a mobile overview


change route names
    m_comparison -> m_addbill 

    should change m_mobile comparison to mobile overview and share a mobile template
        use the overview route but add a @mobile_template('m_overview') to the top so changes look 

        to much to change to get the request.mobile to be true 

        copy mobile overview and made m_overview as a route 

changed login() 
    made it so the route gets directed to m_overview
    have to add a check login befor that 

    made the @main.route('/') go over m_overview to develop the mobile menu
    need to make when request.MOBILE is TRUE can add @is_mobile so a different template is rendered


feb 8th 

getting flow chart links 

https://lucid.app/lucidchart/4a16c627-cdf4-458e-ae06-066a0c0fdea2/edit?shared=true&page=0_0#?folder_id=home&browser=icon


 

templates 
    appliances -> adding to my inventory 
    utilitybills -> my bills overview page making sense of utility bills 

    should make mobile versions of these -> NO NEED CONVERTED DESKTOP TO THESE

need to do one page at a time. 

Following the flow chart there are 3 main branches 
    stats and comparisons
    inventory and energy audit
    home/info/profile

home/overview tab (called overview route)

    home layout
        home page overview
            energuid model when ready 
            home profile
            add bill 
                interpert bill
            contact us

    changes i have made 
        menu "home" renders template m_comparison 
            need to add a add bill section to this page 
            add a contact us on this page as well at the bottom. 

        home profile could still use some more detail
            maybe some graphs and stuff but need more data on the customer
    
    DONE added a bill photo section to m_home_comparison


inventory and energy audit tab 
    make a inventory and audit tab
    basically a copy of the appliance.html tab 
        cannot test out full action because of the appliance projects are not active so do this at a later database
            WILL HAVE TO CHANGE THE REDIRECTS TO m_appliances rather then go back to the appliances, 
            these templates should look fine in mobile

        audit function still needs some work 
    
    when inventory is added should add it to overview menu
    
    after the audit should have more values that can make a chart or somehting on m_home_comparison then redirect there to show the changes 


stats and comparison
    dont know what benchmark graph thing that the gov was using. 

    adding a efficency overview this can be m_upgrades and show savings and upgrades 

    going to get upgrade values 

m_overview 
    current_regress = 0
    light_usage = 2.16
    appliance_usage = 9.27
    ventilation_usage = 0.2
    dhw_usage = 
    
    ALL HARD CODED

KEEP IN MIND ADDBILL DOES NOT COMMIT TO DATABASE, WOULD HAVE TO UPLOAD A BILL EVERY LOG IN for the session 
    db commmit happens in the bill detection area of m_home_comparison


working on upgrades lead to database problems added some try and except statments to roles.py and data.py

no have to make more seeds for a upgrades data

what is the upgrades.csv looks like it was hand made?

non of the links lead anywhere useful.

do you know if the bill detection was build from scratch? because from what i have it looks like it is google functions used to detect bills.

Im still not sure where the real meat and potatos of the code is if it is all in that amazon web service or if there is more to this google service account.



working on comaprison branches
