These are the updates that need to be done

hot water usage. line: 205 calculations.py
    we could make a survey about how people use their hot water there are many online could copy one of those 

incoming water tempurature. line 210 calculations.py    
    will need to change up the function so that the incoming water temp is known for each city 
    could add a variable to home class

More indepth lighting function line 236 calculations.py
    could take into month. lights used more in the winter months 
    christmas lights take up a lot more energy 

oven calculations calculations.py line: 400
    assuming that the oven is used 12 times a month at 1.5 hours 
    we could make questions to determine how much cooking the user does 

stove top useage calcualtions.py line: 420
    we are assummming that it is electric 
    not sure how we would check to see if it is gas or electric maybe we could do a question or image rec

fridge stuff needs some work 
    power of the fridge (hard to base on family size)
    right now we use a average wattage of a fridge 

values to change for accuatacy 

electricity assumptions 
    fridge_lifetime = 18  -> assumptions.py line: 480
    fridge_energy usage = 6.44 -> calculations.py line: 333


we need better weather datainput 
    right now it is a list in output.py 
    we need a date input 

we might need to change how the date is implemented so that it is passed to calculate all. 
    when energy is calculated it gets daily use and multiplies it by 30.5 as average days in a month 
    could make somehting so that we can get the exact number of days in that month

there is some imperial and metric mix ups should be better 


we could make a whole function just to calculate cook times of different appliances line 149 in output.py
    use stove less -> microwave gets used more
    dosnt cookk a lot -> microwave probably gets used a lot 

    for now we will be assuming these cooktime values 
    
update oven,stove,micrrowave energy calculations can be much more detailed 


need to make a way for the user to say if they have upgraded their walls roof or windows:
    we need to make it so we can change the value of a R depending on if they have upgraded the windows walls or roof

update dishwasher predictions assumptions.py -> line 507 
    we just predict a mid range dishwasher that uses 0.64 kwh of energy and 5 gallons of water per load 


unit choices so the user sees a unit that they want to see. 


get sunlight hours of the month am assuming these for all of alberta from this weather site 
    https://weather-and-climate.com/average-monthly-hours-Sunshine,edmonton,Canada

    the sun emits about 1 kw/h per meter squared. this is a very rough estimate so will need to be updated 

    this is about 316.999 BTU/squarefoot but this is a perfect transmition

    calculations.py line 55
        the glazing value is set to 0.8 this could be changed to get a better amount of heating in the house
